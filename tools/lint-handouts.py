"""Structural lint for the Typst handouts.

The companion to lint-decks.py, and it exists for the same reason: every check
here catches a mistake that **compiles cleanly**. `typst compile` succeeding
says nothing about whether the sheet is correct, and the damage lands on paper,
in front of sixteen students, after the printing is done.

    python3 tools/lint-handouts.py               lint every week*/day*/handouts/*.typ
    python3 tools/lint-handouts.py week2/day1    lint one session

Exits non-zero if an error is found, so it can gate a commit. Warnings are
reported separately and do not fail: they are heuristics for the rules in
AUTHORING.md that cannot be decided mechanically.

The checks, and the bug each one is a memorial to:

1. **Cross-references resolve.** A sheet that says "the figures come back in
   panel 4" has to have a panel 4. On 2026-09-20 the µLab 1 worksheet had its
   panels renumbered 5→4 through 12→11; the file compiled, the PDF looked
   right, and two references (`Panel 12` and `panel 5`) still pointed at panels
   that no longer existed. Nothing in the toolchain noticed. AUTHORING.md F3.

2. **Panel numbers contiguous from 1.** The other half of the same renumbering:
   delete a panel and the sequence gains a hole, which nobody sees while
   scrolling but every reader hits when told to go to panel 7.

3. **Stale PDF.** The PDFs are committed built so that printing needs no
   toolchain. That convenience is also the trap: edit the `.typ`, forget to
   recompile, and the printed sheet is the previous draft. Silent, and only
   discovered in the room.

   Compared by **commit time, not mtime**. The first draft of this check used
   `os.path.getmtime` and reported three of the six handouts as stale on
   2026-09-20; all three were false. Git does not record mtimes, so a checkout
   stamps every file with the time it was written to disk and the comparison
   is noise. Mtime is used only while a source is uncommitted, where it is the
   only signal there is.

4. **Template drift.** All six handouts pin `isc-hei-document:0.8.1` and
   re-type the same preamble rather than sharing one. Six copies drift; a
   version bump in one file changes that sheet's layout alone, and the set
   stops looking like a set.

5. **The PII banner.** Filled worksheets carry student names and GitHub handles
   and must never enter git; the blank PDFs are what is committed. That rule
   currently lives in a comment block that a new file can simply omit. Any
   instrument collected from students has to carry it. A sheet that is handed
   out and never comes back says so instead, in the same banner, which is why
   `flipped-worksheets.typ` passes without the paragraph.

6. *(warning)* **The checkpoint bar.** µLabs stopped being micro and students
   stopped finishing them. The structural fix is a ten-minute core, a
   checkpoint the referee ticks on the spot, then marked extensions. A ulab
   worksheet without one has no core/extension boundary at all.

   A warning rather than an error, for one reason: the two week1/day2 sheets
   were delivered before the checkpoint existed and are not being rewritten. A
   linter that is red on a clean tree stops being read, and then checks 1 to 5
   stop being read with it. AUTHORING.md G1.

7. *(warning)* **A console block with no flag table.** AUTHORING.md B2: every
   argument of every command line is explained. Three separate commits on
   2026-09-20 went back and added tables that should have been in the first
   draft. The heuristic looks for the two-column `#grid` idiom near a
   multi-line console block. Only blocks whose **first** line is a command are
   considered: a pasted `watch` screen is expected output, not something to
   tabulate. It still cannot tell a deliberate omission from a forgotten one,
   so it warns.

8. *(warning)* **Rejected title forms.** AUTHORING.md A1 and A2. Not a grammar
   check: an explicit list of the constructions that were actually rejected,
   which recur because they are the shapes a draft falls into. "Two lines from
   the watch, and the reason", "What you started", "A wish is not a command".
